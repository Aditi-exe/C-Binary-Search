# Binary Search 

Binary search is an algorithm for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the search interval is empty. 
Binary search requires the array to be sorted in order for it to work correctly. If the array is not sorted, binary search will not find the target value correctly.
